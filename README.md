# JSON FORMS

An experiment in implementing JSON forms in a React app.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the project up and running, follow these steps:

1) cd json-forms
2) npm install
3) npm start

Each example has a series of JSON files that control their respective forms, and can be edited by a user to change the setup.
